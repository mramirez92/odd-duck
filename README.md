## Motivation

This project was really about creating a web page that is interactive and renders user input visually in a chart while storing it locally. The page asks the user to vote on random products a certain number of times, displaying the results after voting has completed. I used events that were triggered by user clicks to store information into objects which were then rendered with DOM manipulation. The chart uses the object information triggered by event to display voting results on a chart. Objects are stored in local storage through JSON allowing product views/counts to be saved and tallied up while the page is live.
